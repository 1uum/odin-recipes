        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>An empanada is a pastry or turnover that's filled with savory ingredients and served hot. They also can be baked or fried!  </p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <p><li>½ pound ground beef </li></p>
            <p><li>3 tablespoons butter </li></p>
            <p><li>2 medium onions, chopped </li></p>
            <p><li>1 green onion, chopped </li></p>
            <p><li>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped </li></p>
            <p><li>14 pitted green olives, such as Manzanilla, finely chopped </li></p>
            <p><li>3 tablespoons raisins </li></p>
            <p><li>1 teaspoon cumin </li></p>
            <p><li>½ teaspoon salt </li></p>
            <p><li>¼ teaspoon black pepper </li></p>
            <p><li>2 (17.5 ounce) packages frozen puff pastry (each with 2 sheets), thawed </li></p>
            <p><li>1 raw egg, lightly beaten </li></p>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Set racks in upper and lower thirds of oven, and preheat to 450 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.</li></p>
            <p><li>Cook beef in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer beef to a small bowl with a slotted spoon, and pour off grease from skillet. Melt butter in skillet and saute onions and green onion, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Return beef to skillet and stir in hard-boiled eggs, olives, raisins, cumin, salt, and pepper. Transfer mixture to a shallow bowl and chill until cooled, 10 to 20 minutes.</li></p>
            <p><li>Unfold 1 pastry sheet, keeping remaining chilled, onto a lightly floured surface, dust lightly with flour, and roll out into a 12-inch square. Cut 4 (5 1/2-inch) rounds from pastry. Brush a 1/2-inch border around edges of 1 round with water, using a small brush or fingertip. Spoon about 3 tablespoons of filling onto half of round. Fold other half over filling and press edges together firmly. Crimp edges with a fork and transfer to one of prepared baking sheets. Repeat with 3 remaining rounds. Form 12 more empanadas in same manner with remaining pastry and filling, arranging them about 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets.</li></p>
            <p><li>Brush tops of empanadas with beaten egg. Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through, until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li></p>
        </ol>
